# Insurance Underwriting Assistant

The **Insurance Underwriting Assistant** is a modular multi-agent framework designed to automate underwriting and claims workflows for Hartford's business insurance operations. It replicates the functions of a real-world insurance operations desk, seamlessly coordinating across multiple teams and performing the roles of various operational units. Key capabilities include ACORD form validation, risk assessment, underwriting decision generation, and claims intake.

The system is currently running in demo mode, demonstrating how agents would work together to process insurance workflows once connected to live data.

## Description

This network has a Front Man agent that serves as the main interface for business insurance operations. Users submit requests in plain language, and the assistant determines the task and the best course of action to complete it. For example, a risk evaluation request is broken down into subtasks such as property verification, hazard assessment, and risk scoring, which are assigned to specialized agents or sub-agents, who may further delegate them to downstream agents. If additional information is needed, the Front Man prompts the user for input and then gathers all relevant agent responses into a complete, final answer delivered to the user.

- **Domain Expertise Delegation**: The system routes each part of an inquiry to agents with expertise in that area. Agents work independently or delegate tasks to downstream agents, ensuring that each workflow step is handled efficiently and accurately.

- **Human-like Dialogue Management**:
The assistant communicates with users through a natural language interface (the Front Man) while managing agent collaboration in the background. All responses are presented in plain language without insurance jargon, making complex processes easier to understand and follow. This guidance helps users complete tasks, identify and resolve issues in their application or profile, and follow a step-by-step roadmap to navigate insurance workflows.

- **Coordinated Workflow Execution**:
The Front Man agent, sub-agents, and downstream agents communicate seamlessly to transfer information and, when needed, request additional details from the user. This approach eliminates the manual coordination that would otherwise be required between teams, significantly improving the speed of task execution.

- **Reliable and Policy-Compliant Decisions**:
Core processes such as claims intake, investigation, and underwriting decision-making are fully automated. This automation minimizes manual errors and oversights, ensures data-backed and consistent outcomes across all users, and keeps decisions aligned with Hartford’s business policies. As a result, overall operational efficiency improves, and turnaround times are reduced.
