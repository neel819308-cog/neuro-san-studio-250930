# Retail Operations and Customer Service Assistant

The **Retail Operations and Customer Service Assistant** is a modular multi-agent system for automating customer support in retail. It simulates a helpdesk with agents managing orders, returns, refunds, product information, and escalations. Using domain-specific delegation, the system provides personalized support to user while adhering to company policies. It currently runs in demo mode without data integration and is designed for easy connection to live systems. The architecture is scalable to support functions such as inventory forecasting, supplier management, and loyalty programs.

## Description

The assistant operates through a hierarchical architecture led by the "Frontman" Customer Support Agent, who serves as the primary point of contact. This agent delegates customer inquiries to specialized downstream agents responsible for domains such as orders, returns, marketing, product information, inventory availability, and more. Each agent may further delegate tasks to sub-agents, ensuring that all inquiries are handled from the company’s perspective and in accordance with company policies, while maintaining clarity and helpfulness.

- **Domain Expertise Delegation**: Inquiries are routed to specialized agents focused on orders, returns, refunds, product information, promotions, fulfillment, logistics, and escalations. Agents may delegate subtasks downstream to sub-agents or coded tool and compile responses to provide precise, context-aware answers.
- **Human-like Dialogue Management**: The frontman agent manages the entire conversation flow, abstracting multi-agent collaboration to deliver a natural user experience.
- **Interactive Follow-ups**: If required, agents may request additional information from the user before responding, using human-friendly prompts.
- **Escalation Handling**: Complex or unresolved inquiries are escalated with full context to the appropriate teams.
