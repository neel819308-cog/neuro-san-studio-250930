# To use this agent network with Brave Search, obtain an API key from: https://brave.com/search/api/
# Once you have the API key, set it using the BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable.
# You can optionally set a custom search URL via the BRAVE_URL environment variable.
# If BRAVE_URL is not set, the default is: https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=
# You can also configure the request timeout (in seconds) using BRAVE_TIMEOUT; the default is 30 seconds.

        #   1) Cannot use a CodedTool "class" definition
