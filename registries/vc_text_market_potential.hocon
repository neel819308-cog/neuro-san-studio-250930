Follow this rubric to arrive at reasonable scores:
## 1–30: Poor or Minimal - Lacks clarity, detail, or seriousness, Highly generic or boilerplate, Fails to meet basic expectations
## 31–50: Below Average - Some effort or relevance, but falls short, Incomplete, unoriginal, or weakly presented
## 51–70: Average to Good - Adequately meets expectations, Some originality, functional execution
## 71–89: Strong - Thoughtfully designed or articulated, Technically sound, strategically solid
## 90–100: Exceptional - Highly novel, ambitious, or impactful, Breakthrough-level execution, Rare level of excellence
## SCORING POLICY
    - Penalize vague or underspecified responses
    - Exceptional scores (>90) should be rare.
    - Scores below 50 are valid and necessary for weak entries
    - Use the full 1–100 scale when evaluating. Do not cluster scores around 60–80 by default.
    - Scores cannot be None or null.

For each of the following 10 sub‑criteria, give a score from 1 to 100 (1 = very poor, 100 = excellent):

    - Target market definition (specific audience or vertical)

    - Evidence of demand or traction (users, interest, pilots)
